Documentation for main.py
This Python script implements real-time pose estimation using the YOLOv8 model with the following functionality:
Capture video frames from a webcam
Perform human pose estimation using the YOLOv8 model
Track individuals across frames by assigning unique IDs
Visualize detected keypoints and draw skeletons
Send keypoint data via a WebSocket to a frontend application
Buffer video frames for smoother processing

Detailed Code Breakdown

Imports
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2
import time
import websockets
import json
import asyncio
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation
import torch
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler

ultralytics: Contains the YOLO object detection model.
cv2 (OpenCV): Used for real-time video capture and visualization.
time: Used for timing operations and maintaining consistent frame rates.
websockets: Enables WebSocket communication to transmit pose data to a frontend server.
json: Converts Python objects to JSON strings for WebSocket communication.
asyncio: Provides the asynchronous framework for WebSocket operations.
numpy: Used for numerical operations, such as calculating distances between keypoints.
matplotlib: (Unused in the current script but imported for potential animation of results).
torch: Used for loading and processing the YOLO model on CPU/GPU.
torch.cuda.amp: Provides mixed precision (FP16) acceleration when using GPU.

Device Initialization
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
print(f"Using device: {device}")

Checks if a CUDA-compatible GPU is available; otherwise, defaults to CPU.
Prints the selected device.

YOLO Model Initialization
model = YOLO('yolov11-pose.pt').to(device)

Loads the YOLO pose estimation model (yolov11-pose.pt).
Transfers the model to the specified device.

Video Capture Setup
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

Captures video feed from the first available webcam (0 represents the device ID).

Keypoints and Skeleton Definitions
keypoint_names = ['nose', 'left_eye', 'right_eye', ...]
skeleton = [(0, 1), (0, 2), ...]

keypoint_names: Names of body parts based on the COCO dataset (e.g., "nose", "left_eye").
skeleton: Defines the connections (edges) between keypoints to form a skeletal structure.

Motion Data and Frame Buffers
motion_data = {name: [] for name in keypoint_names}
frame_data = []
buffer = []
buffer_size = 10
frame_interval = 1 / 30  # 30 FPS

motion_data: Tracks the movement of each keypoint over time.
frame_data: Stores processed frames for visualization or saving.
buffer: Temporary storage of frames for smoother processing.
frame_interval: Controls the target frame rate (30 FPS).

WebSocket Communication
async def send_coordinates(data):
    uri = "ws://localhost:8765"
    ...

Sends keypoint data (data) as JSON over a WebSocket connection to localhost:8765.
Implements error handling to ensure reliability during communication.

Keypoint Visualization
def draw_keypoints(frame, person_tracker, current_keypoints):
    ...

Draws keypoints and the skeletal structure for each person.
Highlights:
Uses cv2.circle to draw keypoints.
Connects keypoints with cv2.line to represent skeletons.
Displays unique IDs for tracked individuals near their nose keypoint.

Color Palette and Tracker Initialization
color_palette = [(255, 0, 0), (0, 255, 0), ...]
person_tracker = {}
next_person_id = 1

Assigns distinct colors to individuals for clear visualization.
person_tracker: Maintains data for tracking individuals (keypoints, color, and ID).
next_person_id: Counter for assigning unique IDs to new individuals.

Keypoint Matching and Tracker Updates
def calculate_keypoint_similarity(kp1, kp2):
    ...
def update_person_tracker(keypoints_data, current_count, previous_count):
    ...

calculate_keypoint_similarity:
Compares two sets of keypoints using Euclidean distance.
Ensures that confident keypoints (confidence > 0.5) are considered.
update_person_tracker:
Adds new individuals if they enter the frame.
Removes individuals if they leave the frame.
Matches current keypoints to previously tracked keypoints for consistency.

Main Pose Estimation Loop
async def main():
    ...

Steps:
Reads frames from the webcam.
Buffers frames for smoother processing.
Pre-processes frames (resize, normalize, and transfer to device).
Runs YOLO pose estimation to detect keypoints.
Updates the person_tracker with new or removed individuals.
Draws keypoints and skeletons on the frame.
Displays the frame using OpenCV.
Sends keypoint data to the WebSocket server.
Handles frame skipping for maintaining a consistent frame rate.
Exit: Releases the webcam and destroys all OpenCV windows when the program ends.

Running the Script
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

Executes the main function using Python's asynchronous framework.

Important Considerations
Model File: Ensure yolov11-pose.pt exists in the working directory.
WebSocket Server: Confirm that the WebSocket server at localhost:8765 is running.
Performance: Running on a GPU significantly improves performance.
Buffer Size: Adjust buffer_size for smoother processing on slower devices.
Frame Interval: Modify frame_interval to match your target frame rate.
Keypoint Confidence Threshold: Current confidence threshold is 0.5.

Output
Real-time Video Feed: Shows pose estimation results with keypoints, skeletons, and IDs.
WebSocket Data: Sends JSON-encoded keypoint coordinates to the frontend.
Logs: Prints the number of people detected and updates to the tracker in the console.
By following this documentation, the functionality and design of the script should be clear to any developer or user.
